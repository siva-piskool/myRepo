            Building our Single Page App The way we build our app is no different
            than all the apps we've been building so far. We will have a main
            parent component. Each of the individual "pages" of our app will be
            separate components that feed into the main component. The magic React
            Router brings to to the table is basically choosing which components
            to show and which to hide. To make this feel natural, all of this
            navigating is tied in with our browser's address bar and back/forward
            buttons, so it is all made to look seamless. Displaying the Initial
            Frame When building a SPA, there will always be a part of your page
            that will remain static. This static part, also referred to as an app
            frame, could just be one invisible HTML element that acts as the
            container for all of your content, or could include some additional
            visual things like a header, footer, navigation, etc. In our case, our
            app frame will just be a component that contains UI elements for our
            navigation header and an empty area for content to load in.
